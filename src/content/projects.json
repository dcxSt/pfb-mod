		"description":"The polyphase filter bank is essentially a down-sampled spectrogram with overlapping windows that is used in radio astronomy to channelize data from telescopes such as chime an hirax for detecting fast radio bursts. Under prof. Jon Sievers' guidance I developed and tested methods for cleanly and efficiently inverting the PFB. This will make further analysis of FRB's easier."
