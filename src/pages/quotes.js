                <i>Crab:</i> It seems to me that ants are free only within certain constraints. For example, they are free to wander, to brush against each other, to pick up small items, to work on trails, and so on. But they never step out of that small world, that ant-system, which they are in. It would never occur to them, for they don't have the mentality to imagine anything of the kind. Thus the ants are very reliable components, in the sense that you can depend on them to perform certain kinds of tasks in certain ways. <br/><br/> <i>Achilles:</i> But even so, within those limits they are still free, and they just act at random, running about incoherently without any regard for the thought mechanisms of a higher-level being which Dr. Anteater asserts they are merely components of.<br/><br/><b>Douglas Hofstadter (in GEB)</b>

                In the domain of high energy physics, the curvature of spacetime is so small it hardly matters. Well at least this is what people thought for a long time. Till Maldacena came up with his Ads CFT correspondance. Maldacena showed that a computation in high energy physics which is QFT, which has nothing to do with gravity, can alternatively be derived from Einstein theory. Which means that, people who thought they would never need gravity to understand quantum field theory where completely taken aback because you can either do a very hard computation in QFT, can be captured by a very simple computation in Einstein's theory. In fact an impossible question in the QFT side, can be done in one line on the gravity side. His version is called Ads / CFT correspondance, Ads is a very special gravity and CFT is a very special quantum field theory. But you can generalize it to guage theory and gravity correspondence. <br/><br/> So people who thought 'okay we'll never need einstein theory of gravity', and then they where stuck at very difficult questions in quantum field thoery that they couldn't figure out how to solve this thing. And out came this relationship where years and years where spent with no progress in QFT became a one line excersize on this side (puts mouse over ETh). So people who thought they would never need Einstein gravity had to go back and start learning GR, and you suddenly see in the ArXiv many of the people of QFT are now writing papers on GR, because they have now learned GR. So that you know that just because a subject is esoteric doesn't mean it's not useful.

                According to the classical theory of radiation, if each Fourier mode of the equilibrium radiation (in an otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls) is considered as a degree of freedom capable of exchanging energy, then, according to the equipartition theorem of classical physics, there would be an equal amount of energy in each mode. Since there are an infinite number of modes, this would imply infinite heat capacity, as well as a nonphysical spectrum of emitted radiation that grows without bound with increasing frequency, a problem known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.

                What I didn't realize is that the structure of the Universities was that they were either hitting steady-state or growing very little or shrinking and that was a not a healthy place to be. Most of the good seats in the musical chairs competition had already been foudn in the 60s and they had occupants and we were in some sort of a game where we were doing work for the system but we weren't set to inherit it. [...] Even though I wanted to do science rather than technology, it's better to be in an expanding world and not quite in exactly the right field, than to be in a contracting world where people's worst behavior comes out and your mind is grooved in defensive and rent-seeking types of ways. 

                [...] If you take Hydra - they may come in a - these tiny microscopic animals - they come in a sexual variety and a sexless variety. It always seems to be that the thing that reproduces sexually senesces and gets old and dies. But sometimes the thing that doesn't reproduce sexually seems to have some sort of immortality properties. So there's some relationship between sex and death that we don't quite understand. 

                [...] Schrodinger (Erwin), didn't really contribute into physics I think until his 40s and 50s, which was very late by the standards of the day. So sometimes you, at a personal level, you just have to get lucky in order to understand what it is that you're supposed to be doing. 

                [..] There was a news story that moved me and a lot of other people about a father who knew he was dying and came up with five years worth of birthday cards and flowers to send to the daughter, who then turned 21. She was sad that this was the last one she was getting.

                I thought, why is this a news story? Why aren’t we all doing this? Why only five years? And I read this story and I still didn’t do anything about it. 

                So I think that, in some sense, if you guys want to lead the way and talk about how we play with death, rather than whistling past the graveyard, how we dance past it, and how we you know develop a more mature relationship, how we get excited about planning our wake, and thinking about the order of people we want to speak, and you know what we want to reveal years after we’re gone so that we can continue to have these conversations.

                [...] So just try to try to think about the fact that death is simply part of a program that is already immortal, which is the theory of lineage. Whether it’s the lineage of your ideas or the lineage of your genes, these things matter to all of us while we’re here and it’s one of the most exciting things to think about

                <i>Haiku</i> and <i>waka</i> poems convey perhaps more easily than painting the subtle differences between the four moods of <i>sabi</i>, <i>wabi</i>, <i>aware</i>, and <i>yugen</i>. The quiet, thrilling loneliness of <i>sabi</i> is obvious in <br/><br/>
                
                <haiku style={{margin:`85px`}}>On a withered branch<br/></haiku><haiku style={{margin:`105px`}}>A crow is perched,<br/></haiku><haiku style={{margin:`125px`}}>In the autumn evening.</haiku>
                
                <br/><br/>But it is less obvious and therefore deeper in <br/><br/>

                <haiku style={{margin:`85px`}}>With the evening breeze,<br/></haiku><haiku style={{margin:`105px`}}>The water laps against<br/></haiku><haiku style={{margin:`125px`}}>The heron's legs.</haiku><br/>
                
                <blockquote><i>In the dark forest<br/><br/>A berry drops:<br/><br/>The sound of the water.</i></blockquote>
                <i>Sabi</i> is, however, loneliness in the sense of Bhuddhist detachment, of seeing all things happening "by themselves" in miraculous spontaneity. With this goes that sense of deep, illimitable quietude which descends with a long fall of snow, swallowing all sounds in layer upon layer of softness.
                <blockquote><i>Sleet falling;<br/><br/>Fathomless, infinite<br/><br/>Loneliness.</i></blockquote>
                <i>Wabi</i>, the unexpected recognition of the faithful "suchness" of very ordinary things, especially when the gloom of the future has momentarily checked our ambitiousness, is perhaps the mood of
                <blockquote><i>A brushwood gate,<br/><br/>And for a lock-<br/><br/>This snail.</i></blockquote>
                <blockquote><i>The woodpecker<br/><br/>Keeps on in the same place:<br/><br/>Day is closing.</i></blockquote>
                <blockquote><i>Winter desolation;<br/><br/>In the rain-water tub,<br/><br/>Sparrows are walking.</i></blockquote>
                <i>Aware</i> is not quote grief, and not quite nostalgia in the usual sense of longing for the return of a beloved past. <i>Aware</i> is the echo of what has passed and of what was loved, giving them a resonance such as a great cathedral gives to a choir, so that they would be the poorer without it. 
                <blockquote><i>No one lives at the Barrier of Fuha;<br/><br/>The wooden penthouse is fallen away;<br/><br/>All that remains<br/><br/>Is the autumn wind.</i></blockquote>
                <blockquote><i>The evening haze;<br/><br/>Thinking of past things,<br/><br/>How far-off they are!</i></blockquote>
                <i>Aware</i> is the moment of crisis between seeing the transience of the world with sorrow and regret, and seeing it as the very form of the Great Void.
                <blockquote><i>The stream hides itself<br/><br/>In the grasses<br/><br/>Of departing autumn.</i></blockquote>
                <blockquote><i>Leaves falling,<br/><br/>Lie on one another;<br/><br/>The rain beats on the rain.</i></blockquote>
                That moment of transition is just about to "cross over" in the <i>haiku</i> written by Issa upon the death of his child:
                <blockquote><i>This dewdrop world-<br/><br/>It may be a dewdrop,<br/><br/>And yet-and yet-</i></blockquote>
                Since <i>yugen</i> signifies a kind of mystery, it is the most baffling of all to describe, and the poems must speak for themselves.
                <blockquote><i>The sea darkens;<br/><br/>The voices of the wild ducks<br/><br/>Are faintly white.</i></blockquote>
                <blockquote><i>The skylark:<br/><br/>Its voice alone fell,<br/><br/>Leaving nothing behind.</i></blockquote>
                <blockquote><i>In the dense mist,<br/><br/>What is being shouted<br/><br/>Between hill and boat?</i></blockquote>
                <blockquote><i>A trout leaps;<br/><br/>Clouds are moving<br/><br/>In the bed of the stream.</i></blockquote>
                Or an example of <i>yugen</i> in the <i>Zenrin</i> poems:
                <blockquote><i>Wind subsiding, the flowers still fall;<br/><br/>Bird crying, the mountain silence deepens.</i></blockquote>

He argued for the virtues of being free not from repression but "from the fear of poverty and hunger, of which I hold vivid childhood memories." When he wrote in his own name, not on behalf of the Bank, he was even more strident: he dismissed the "optimistic, and perhaps naive, argument put forward by some scholars that democracies... are more likely to undertake economic reforms."

For example, love for the country or the perseverance you get from overcoming hardship. Those virtues—I don’t see them in myself and many people my age.” Of Tang Jie, she said, “From that kind of background, with nobody educated in his family, nobody helping him with his schoolwork, with great family pressure, it’s not easy for him to get where he is today.” [...]<br/><br/>

But finally, we must admit that the Chinese government had to use any way it could to put down that event.” [...]<br/><br/>

                Gone are the days - I thought - when you were learning to fly your little propeller plane, which you could almost steer with the weight of your body, without losing sight of your friends on the ground. From now on, you will be up in the blue empty sky where there is nothing to see and to trust but instruments, instruments that will tell you where you are and where you are going, even though all around be night and mist. And you'd better learn to make the best possible use of those instruments, for your survival depends on it. The mathematical formalism of wave functions and operators will keep you afloat above a microscopic world that is too small to see, but not to imagine.

                **Simplicio** The notion of physical realist is a "category" or a schema of thought which we need in order to render intelligible the totality of the content of consciousness. We cannot give a definition of "reality" without getting involved in circularity, but there is no obstacle to using such a concept as a heuristic principle, justified entirely by its usefulness.<br/><br/>

                **Sagredo** Now I understand why Newton needed a God to put his planets in motion. It is evident that his laws of motion could not give him any other solutions for the planetary obits which are not observed. There is nothing in these laws which would require these particular solutions with the exact number and size of planets as they are observed. And is it not natural to assume that the particular arragement of the planets with nearly circular orbits, all in the same plane and with the same direction of motion, shows the hand of the original designer?<br/><br/>
                **Salviati** Yes, that was Newton's quest. And I believe he was deeply aware that every real event is something single and unique, which in a strict sense never happens again. Some of his followers may have forgotten that important point. It is the very essence of a physical law that it refers to reproducible physical situations and therefore, strictly speaking, never to an individual even, or rather to individual events only insofar as they are members of an ensemble of similar events.  <br/><br/>

                Shore asked him how he had become a psychologist. "It's hard to know how people select a course in life," Amos said. "The big choices we make are practically random. The small choices probably tell us more about who we are. Which field we go into may depend on which high school teacher we happen to meet. Who we marry may depend on who happens to be around at the right time of life. On the other hand, the small decisions are very systematic. That I became a psychologist is probably not very revealing.

                It would be easy to read about the studies on entity vs. incremental theories of intelligence and come to the conclusion that a child should never win or lose. I don't believe this is the case. If that child discovers any ambition to pursue excellence in a given field later in life, he or she may lack the toughness to handle inevitable obstacles. While a fixation on results is certainly unhealthy , short-term goals can be useful developmental tools if they are balanced within a nurturing long-term philosophy. Too much sheltering from results can be stunting. The road to success is not easy or else everyone would be the greatest at what they do - we need to be psychologically prepared to face the unavoidable challenges along our way, and when it comes down to it, the only way to learn how to swim is by getting in the water. <br/><br/><b>Josh Waitzkin</b>

                The student's biggest problem was a slave mentality which had been built into him by years of carrot-and- whip grading, a mule mentality which said, "If you don't whip me, I won't work.'' He didn't get whipped. He didn't work. And the cart of civilization, which he supposedly was being trained to pull, was just going to have to creak along a little slower without him.
                This is a tragedy, however, only if you presume that the cart of civilization, "the system,'' is pulled by mules. This is a common, vocational, "location'' point of view, but it's not the Church attitude.
                The Church attitude is that civilization, or "the system'' or "society'' or whatever you want to call it, is best served not by mules but by free men. The purpose of abolishing grades and degrees is not to punish mules or to get rid of them but to provide an environment in which that mule can turn into a free man.
                The hypothetical student, still a mule, would drift around for a while. He would get another kind of education quite as valuable as the one he'd abandoned, in what used to be called the "school of hard knocks.'' Instead of wasting money and time as a high-status mule, he would now have to get a job as a low-status mule, maybe as a mechanic. Actually his real status would go up. He would be making a contribution for a change. Maybe that's what he would do for the rest of his life. Maybe he'd found his level. But don't count on it.
                In time…six months; five years, perhaps…a change could easily begin to take place. He would become less and less satisfied with a kind of dumb, day-to-day shopwork. His creative intelligence, stifled by too much theory and too many grades in college, would now become reawakened by the boredom of the shop. Thousands of hours of frustrating mechanical problems would have made him more interested in machine design. He would like to design machinery himself. He'd think he could do a better job. He would try modifying a few engines, meet with success, look for more success, but feel blocked because he didn't have the theoretical information. He would discover that when before he felt stupid because of his lack of interest in theoretical information, he'd now find a brand of theoretical information which he'd have a lot of respect for, namely, mechanical engineering.

                No continuum in mathematics and therefore no continuum in physics. A half-century of development in the sphere of mathematical logic has made it clear that there is no evidence supporting the belief in the existential character of the number continuum. "Belief in this transcendental world," Hermann Weyl tells us, "taxes the strength of our faith hardly less than the doctrines of the early Fathers of the Church or of the scholastic philosophers of the Middle Ages". This lesson out of mathematics applies with equal strength to physics. "Just as the introduction of the irrational numbers... is a convenient myth [which] simplifies the laws of arithmetic... so physical objects," William Van Orman Quine tells us "are postulated entities which round out and simplify level answer."[...]<br/><br/>
                <i>Fourth and last no</i>: No space, no time. Heaven did not hand down the word "time". Man invented it, perhaps positing hopefully as he did that "Time is Nature's way to keep everything from happening all at once". If there are problems with the concept of time, they are of our own creation! As Leibniz tells us, "... time and space are not things, but orders of things...;" or as Einstein put it, "Time and space are modes by which we think, and not conditions in which we live."<br/><br/>
                What are we to say about the weld of space and time into spacetime which Einstein gave us in his 1915 and still standard classical geometrodynamics? On this geometry quantum theory, we know, imposes fluctuations. Moreover, the predicted fluctuations grow so great at distances of the order of the Planck length that in that domain they put into question the connectivity of space and deprive the very concepts of "before" and "after" of all meaning. This circumstance reminds us anew that no account of existence can ever hope to rate as fundamental which does not translate all of continuum physics into the language of bits. We will not feed time into any deep-reaching account of existence. We must derive time - and time only in the continuum idealization - out of it. Likewise with space.[...] <br/><br/>
                Deplore? No, celebrate the absence of a clear definition of the term "bit" as elementary unit in the establishment of meaning. We reject "that view of science which used to say, 'Define your terms before you proceed.' The truly creative nature of any forward step in human knowledge," we know, "is such that theory, concept, law and method of measurement - forever inseparable - are born into the world in union." If and when we learn how to combine bits in fantastically large numbers to obtain what we call existence, we will know better what we mean both by bit and by existence. <br/><br/>
                A single question animates this report: Can we ever expect to understand existence? Clues we have, and work to do, to make headway on the issue. Surely someday, we can believe, we will grasp the central idea of it all as so simple, so beautiful, so compelling that we will all say to each other, "Oh, how could it have been otherwise! How could we all have been so blind so long!"<br/><br/>

                We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way. <br/><br/> And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate. [...] <br/><br/>Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. Dostoevski said once, "There is only on thing that I drea: not to be worthy of my sufferings." These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whos suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom - which cannot be taken away - that makes life meaningful and purposeful.[...] <br/><br/>

Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the resposibility to find the right answers to its problems and to fulfil the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. <br/><br/>
                These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differe from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is imporssible to define the meaning of life in a general way.[...]

Thus far we have shown that the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. [...] Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized.
