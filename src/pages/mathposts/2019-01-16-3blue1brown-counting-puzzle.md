This is a problem a friend of mine and I had a go at in January which was pretty fun. Check out the [3 blue 1 brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs) and [here is the solution](https://github.com/dcxSt/Maths-and-Physics-problems/blob/master/3_Blue_1_Brown_Jan_2019_Challenge.pdf) which we found *before* the solution video was released :)
