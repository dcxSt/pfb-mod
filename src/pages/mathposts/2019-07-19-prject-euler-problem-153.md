Hey found this cute problem on project euler: [Investigating Gaussian Integers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=153) and I was missing writing proofs so I wrote out my solution and prooved that my algorithem worked. [Here is the script](https://github.com/dcxSt/project-euler/blob/master/problem%20153%20gaussian%20integers/problem153.py) that computes the answer, it's in python and runs in under 2 minuits, and [here is the solution and proof int the git repo](https://github.com/dcxSt/project-euler/blob/master/problem%20153%20gaussian%20integers/Project_Euler_Problem_153___Gaussian_Integers.pdf) and [here it is again](./Project_Euler_problem_153__Gaussian_Integers.pdf) - actually embedding a pdf into the site is gonna take more than 5 minuits so i gotta go and do work [follow this link to find out more](https://github.com/abemedia/jekyll-pdf) and [this one too](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30745981/opening-pdf-in-a-browser-with-github-pages) presented more or less nicely.

Summary:
The problem asks you to find the sum of the positive real parts of the Gaussian integer factors of all \\(k \leq 10^8\\). This problem can be solved using some cool symmetries and a bit of math to drastically reduce the run-time.
