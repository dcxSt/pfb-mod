For the past two years I have focused more on math than on phyiscs. Now I am going to focus more on phsyics. This is a glossary of the fundamental constants and units, their units and what they are good for.

## Constants
### Vacuum Permiativity
$$\epsilon_0$$ has units $$8.85\cdot 10^{-12} F/m = 55.3 \frac{e^2}{GeV\cdot fm}$$. This constant appears in the coulomb attraction equaiton, for instance between point charges
$$F = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi R^2 \epsilon_0}$$

## Fundamental Units
### Farad
An SI derived unit of capacitance - which is a ratio of how much voltage increase there is per colomb of charge added to a system. The units are $$C/V = C^2/J = \frac{A^2s^4}{kg m^2}$$
