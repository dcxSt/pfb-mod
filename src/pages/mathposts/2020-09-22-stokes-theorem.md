# Stokes Theorem
Stokes theorem is one of the most fundamental theorems at the heart of differential geometry, with a wide range of applications. Understanding it in it's invarient form is insightful when learning about it's it's applications, which are numerous in physics. 

## Preliminaries
Differential forms, 
$$\Omega^k = \{\omega :M\to T^kM\}$$
[...]

exact forms, 
$$\Omega^0\xrightarrow[]{d} \Omega^1 \xrightarrow[]{d} \cdots \xrightarrow[]{d} \Omega^k \xrightarrow[]{d} \cdots$$
[...]

closed forms, 
$$d\omega$$ is exact and $$\omega : d\omega=0$$ is closed
[...]

the cochain complex and the deRham cohomology.

## Statement and Proof
Here we replicate the statement and proof of this beautiful theorem from Spivac's "calculus on manifolds". 

[...]

punchline
$$\int_\Omega d\omega = \int_{\partial\Omega} \omega$$

### Integration by Parts is just stokes theorem.  
$$\int_{\partial\Omega} gf = \int_{\Omega} d(gf) = \int_{\Omega} fdg + \int_{\Omega} gdf$$

### Application to magnetostatics

### Divergence Theorem

### Curl, Green's theorem

### All of Green's identities
