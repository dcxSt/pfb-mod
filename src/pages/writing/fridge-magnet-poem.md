<poem>Sweet jewel shine dark as the glittering summer star light,<br/> 
Night sky mirror heavens glance on the lake water,<br/>
Play the moon's milky voice to laugh in the rain's happy twinkle, <br/>
Go on my fool cry sing play for love's diamond is a cloud</poem>

I wrote this poem with fridge magnets on a fridge and thought nothing of it, my brother read it and insists that it was an inspired work of genius. What do you think?
