The message came with a note:

Read me please do but yoo shall find, 
That Clifford Phallus has you in a bind, 
For your message has been scrambled, 
By Srinivasa's little friendz.

Watch your Pees and Ques now Bob, 
For today they are lucky, 
Add one to one and obtain "rohjy", 
Left by one on the quartz-e, 
The other differs by three by three.

Alice is feeling kind today, 
And sill has some more to say: 
What codes have in common with drink, 
Is not a tree, nor a sore but quite like a hive.

One more thing before the signing, 
Once unscrambled ignore my first two, 
Out of sevin they bare no meaning, 
And have nothing to tell you.

The rest should follow it's one to ome, 
In order of the ABC, 
Goodbye my friend I part with glee.

Backstory: The first version of this riddle was made for my girlfriend, unfortunately she didn't crack it so I re-purposed it as a reply to a poor student who had mistaken me for a prof and sent me an email asking to join my lab. He also failed to solve it to I re-re-purposed it for an english-teacher / redditor with whom I got into a fight with over how to write Haiku properly.

In the words of Keshav Dasgupta "there are many red herring in this problem"
