<br/><br/>
<poem>
The tree-trunk is bodhi's body.<br/>
Buddha's mind can't stand the mirror. <br/>
In chaos nature invented purity. <br/>
Dust gathers in my room.<br/>
</poem>

For context this is reply to Huineng's famous stanza.

<br/>
<poem>
Bodhi originally has no tree.<br/>
The mirror has no stand.<br/>
The Buddha-nature is always clear and pure. <br/>
Where is there room for dust?<br/>
</poem>

<br/>

Which he wrote (actually dictated because he was illiterate) in response to Shenxiu's stanza<br/><br/>

<poem>
The body is the bodhi tree.<br/>
The mind is like a bright mirror's stand.<br/>
At all times we must strive to polish it<br/>
and must not let dust collect.<br/>
</poem>

<br/>

It is my unapolagetic attempt at pointing to the deliciously paradoxical dust that has gathered in the classic Zen refutation of it's own doctrine.
