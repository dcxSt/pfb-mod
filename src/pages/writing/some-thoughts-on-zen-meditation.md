# DRAFT 

In his book <i>Godel Escher Bach</i>, Douglas Hofstadter introduces the notion of an 'active symbol' as a way of thinking about the brain. 

> <i>active elements which can store information and transmit it and recieve it from other active elements. Thus we have active symbols, rather than passive typographical symbols. In the brain the rules are mixed right in with the symbols themselves, whereas on paper, the symbols are static entities, and the rules are in our heads. </i>

<i>D.H. -GEB</i>

Thinking can be understood at a high level of abstraction as the interplay of active symbols in your brain. So when you think of cheese, (theoretically) physically discernable active symbols involved with thoughts of cheese arises in the circuitry of your brain. 

The concept of active symbol is useful because, although it's scientific value is questionable, it describes how many scientifically minded people (physicalists) think about their thoughts. With it we can make (slightly) more precise many vague notions that we may have about how our brain processes information.

In this paradigm, learning a fact about the world is like tr

> <i>The five colours make people's eyes blind,\
> The five sounds make people's ears deaf.</i> 

*Zen saying*

Once you've learned to recognize a pattern as part of a mental model, you no longer see reality as is, you only see the corresponding symbol. The model is a language through which you can communicate things, in which objects are discernible entities. For instance 'blue' and 'sky' are sybmols in your model, that enable you to utter facts such as 'the sky is blue'.

> Don't oppose reality, don't ignore the facts. What is this: my short staff?

*Schuzan*

This is a trick question because opposing reality is akin to stating the fact. If you state the fact 'the sky is blue' you are opposing reality: not only do you ignore all the other possible facts like, 'the air is thin', but even before you make the statement when your brain is busy translating the raw experiance into utterable 'facts', the reality of the experiance is not being lived, your mind is in 'processing mode'. 

If you never take a break from this kind of analytic thinking your psyche will no longer be anchored to solid ground but tethered to a house of cards. Mistaking your models and concepts for reality you start to drift like an unfiltered signal. Once this happens you grow attached to them because you cannot bare the fact that reality is much larger and more mysterious than anything anyone can fathom. 

> Above, not a tile to cover the head; Below, not an inch of ground for the foot. 

*Zen saying*

Reality in it's rawness is richer than any model. The model is contained within your mind, which is inside of reality. The purpose of a model is to help us navigate reality. 

I believe that the fundamental components of the universe and rules which govern their interaction may be intelligible to human kind (some physicists still believe this, some where hopeful that string theory might be an ultimate unifying theory, some are in search of another). In this sense it could be said that the model reflects reality without distorting it. But that's not what I mean by 'reality' in this essay. 

The point is that when you think in symbols, even though you may be thinking about an ultimate physical theory, there is no escaping your flesh and blood experiance of the inner and outer worlds. Sounds manifest, sight occurs, and your mind keeps humming along, this is what is meant by reality. 

> The dear hunter doesn't see the mountain,\
> The miser doesn't see men. 

*Zen saying*

If you get caught up in these models you drift - on the outside it may seem like the opposite, that you have firm convictions and you live by them. I'm not saying that it's bad to have strong oppinions, but that you must hold them loosely, with delecacy. David Foster Wallice said "everybody worships something", I think what he meant by this is - everybody clings to some idea, to some 'facts'. You might cling to money, power, status, religion, being a realist, a determinist, or ironically spritual accomplishment. In doing so you forget that you're a living flesh and blood thinking feeling miracle, and that this fact is in some sense more fundamental than any model you could possibly concieve of. (\*)

However you must not ignore the fact. There is nothing innately wrong or distasteful in accrewing money, power, status, having a religion, being a determinist or accepting any kind of metaphysical view. Indeed all of these things are fine so long as you are able to hold them at arms length every now and then and take joy in their folly. You can't do much without any money or power, everyone who lives in society needs some kind of status, having a religion is great too and so is being a determinist. It's impossible to just reject these things, so you must embrace them. 

> What things are called. The reputation, the name and appearance, the worth and weight of a thing - which are originally and for the mostpart erroneous and arbitrary, which are thrown over the thing like a garmend and are quite alien to its nature and even to its skin - have gradually, through belief in them and their continuous growth from generation to generation, grown into it and become its very body, so to speak; what began as its appearance almost always ends up as its nature, and becomes effective as such! 

*Nietzsche (58 Only as Creators - Gay Science)*

It's hard not to get caught up in our models we are completely submerged in them. Specially those of us in the modern world, rarely do we give ourselves the occasion to interact with reality in an unaltered way. 

> Always, my dear Sir, I wish I could see the things as they are before they show themselves to me. They must be so beautiful and calm.

*Fanz kafka, Conversations with the supplicant*

This is fine too, in fact it's our birthright as humans, building models is what we do best, it's what distinguishes us from the other animals. It's just something to think about from time to time. 

> 'Explanation' is what we call it; but 'description' is what distinguishes us from ealier stages of knowledge and science. We describe better, we explain just as little as our predecessors. 

*Nietzsche (112 Cause and Effect - Gay Science)*

When Newton came up with his laws he didn't think that he had revealed to us the true nature of celestial bodies, (revealed in the sense of the Kafka quote and the Nietzsche quote preceeding it), which is why he made sure to stress that it was 'only a mathematical theory', hence the title 'Principia Mathematica'. Classical mechanics has long since been superseeded by quantum mechanics and Einstein's relativity. If there is an ultimate physical theory, they are closer to it than Newton's, but they both have flaws and are not all encompasing (limited scope).

> Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who sets the planets in motion.

*Isaac Newton* (Remark: the same can be said about QM and GR)

This is why Newton needed to invoke God to set the planets in motion.

Einstein helped us understand space and time better. But space and time (and space-time) are concepts, symbols that belong to models. So are particles, and so is thermodynamics, so is chaos and complexity, emergent phenomena, quantum mechanics, information thoery. It's fun to think about these things because they run deep. But they are not everything. You cannot understand existance without taking the subjective into account.

The same can be said about more mundane models, including those less formal ones that concern relationships with other sapiens such as psychological and political theories, economic facts like "there is a recession". I'm not saying the underlying reality is not there behind the model, only that the model's scope is limited by its limited information content, but this is also what makes it useful!


(\*) *Footnote* To my understanding the Bhuddist 'Doctrine of no Atman' (Atman ~ Soul) goes a step further and claims that this idea that you are a fundamentally a thinking bag of flesh and blood is it's self a misconception (i.e. a model, or an object of maya - the world of illusions), and that those who see through this illusion understand that the distinction between self and other is also a misconception.
