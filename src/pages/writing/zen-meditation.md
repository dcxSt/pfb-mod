In his book <i>Godel Escher Bach</i>, Douglas Hofstadter introduces the notion of an 'active symbol' -- a notion which helps us think about thoughts. 

> <i>active elements which can store information and transmit it and recieve it from other active elements. Thus we have active symbols, rather than passive typographical symbols. In the brain the rules are mixed right in with the symbols themselves, whereas on paper, the symbols are static entities, and the rules are in our heads. </i>

<i>D.H. -GEB</i>

Thinking can be thought of as the interplay of active symbols in your brain. So when you think of cheese, (theoretically) physically discernable active symbols involved with thoughts of cheese arises in the circuitry of your brain. 

The concept of active symbol is perhaps not scientifically meaningful, but it is useful to us because it enables us to describe, qualitatively, how many scientifically minded people think about their thoughts (namely physicalists). With it we can make more precise many vague notions that we may have about how our brain processes information.

*Zen saying*

Once you've learned to recognize a pattern as part of a mental model, the way you percieve reality is altered -- there is now a process in your brain involving active symbols that mirrors and predicts the relevant aspects of said percieved pattern. Pattern recognition is what turns the sea of sensation into discernible entities. For instance 'blue' and 'sky' are sybmols in your model, that enable you to utter facts such as 'the sky is blue', which in turn enables us to communicate usefully with each other.

In Zen and Bhuddism people practice taming their active symbols so that they are not active when they don't need to be. Practitioners aim to enter states of calm serenity and 'one-pointednes' in which their mind is not playing with active symbols, a state in which they can tune in to what it feels like not to be wanting, thinking or worrying about anything. However doing so is difficult because *trying* to do things involves thinking, which involves active symbols. So they are left to attempt to attain these states of calm without trying too hard. This attitude is reflected in 

> <i>Don't oppose reality, don't ignore the facts. What is this: my short staff?</i>

*Schuzan*

It's a trick question because opposing reality is akin to stating the fact. If you state the fact 'the sky is blue' you are opposing reality -- not only do you ignore all the other possible facts like, 'the air is thin', but even before you make the statement when your brain is busy translating the raw experiance into utterable 'facts', the reality of the experiance is not being lived, in other words, your mind is processing active symbols rather than recieving the sensory data without judgement. 

If you never take a break from this kind of analytic thinking your psyche will become tethered to a house of cards: ideas you have about yourself and your place in the world, the ego. Someone with a large ego is constantly 'opposing reality' by interpreting all their experiances as being about them; when someone tells them something they think, how is this actionable, what does it have to do with me, wheras if you say the same thing to a zen monk they will pay more attention to the sound of your voice and allow their brain to make sense of your words effortlessly.

> <i>Above, not a tile to cover the head; Below, not an inch of ground for the foot. </i>

*Zen saying*

Reality in it's rawness is richer than any model -- in other words: the *active symbols* in your head only partially capture the behaviour of some phenomenon. The purpose of a model is to help us navigate reality, but the trade off is that, things which are not captured by your model will go un-noticed.

> The miser doesn't see men.</i> 

*Zen saying*

Zen meditation is about touching base with the raw input every now and then, it's about being observant and allowing things to reveal themselves to you by means of inaction.
