<poem>Don't ask yourself --<br/>
What do I want?<br/>
Ask yourself --<br/>
What does it want of me.<br/><br/>
Paradoxically it seems easier,<br/>
To tell what others want,<br/>
Than what you want.<br/><br/>
The shift from first to third person,<br/>
is pleasant.<br/> 
And reveils beauty in the commonplace.<br/>
The shift from first to third person,<br/>
Can help guide you when your're stuck.<br/><br/>
Paradoxically it seems harder,<br/>
To know what you want,<br/>
Than what is wanted of you.<br/><br/>
Don't ask yourself --<br/>
How can I change things?<br/>
Ask yourself --<br/>
What do the things, want me to do.
</poem>
