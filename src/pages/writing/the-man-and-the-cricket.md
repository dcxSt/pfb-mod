<poem><br/>
There's a little cricket chirping,<br/>
beside a gentle stream.<br/>
The forest is outlined against the sky,<br/>
sky filled with clouds serene.<br/>
<br/>
The dog sits down and is content,<br/>
to watch the stream flow by.<br/>
Trees are happily growing tall,<br/>
yet the man weares his smile wry.
</poem>
