<poem>
There is a fire inside of me<br/>
at times ablaze with dreams and visions <br/>
at times the embers burn slow <br/>
at times merely a heap of smouldering ash <br/>
</poem>

This poem was intended to be a lot longer, but the vivacious burst of inspirationg that got me started burned out fast and I couldn't find words anymore, but I promise I had some really good ideas.
