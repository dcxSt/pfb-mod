Dear body,

Thanks for carrying me around the place. Who even am I to be carried by you? It seems presumptuous to think of myself -your mind, as a seperate enetity. Maybe you would object if you had the capacity to, but the facaulty of thought belongs to *me*.

You have so much power over me. Watching Robert Sapolsky's lectures has made me aware of just how much leverage you have over me. The ideal situation would be for us to get along, I take care of you and you take care of me. If I don't take care of you, you'll react by limiting my physical performance, and my states of mind, enabling torpor and languor to set in.

Thinking about you as a seperate entity is quite strange. What are you anyway, if not me. Are you an interface that allows me to take in sensory data from the outside world. Paraphrasing Alan Watts - the only things that I know, the only things I have ever experianced are states of my nervous system. Every experiance of mine corresponds to the state of a nervous system which presumably grew into me. Appying cartesian scepticism leads us to ask: (a) how can I know that this current state was caused by something before it -- how can I know that there is a past or a future from the present moment? (b) how can I know that other people exist? (solipsism).

It seems obvious to me that there is something wrong with these statements (they do not ring true / feel right / appeal to my tastes). Lets start with (a).

(a) Because the present without the past or the future is meaningless. Unless you happen to know the hamiltonian, taking a spacelike chunk of your system tells you nothing! How can you have motion without time, how can you have anything without time. I don't know. On the one hand, time makes a lot of sense, we have atomic clocks and are able to use these instruments to build things. Every time a sattelite locates someone with GPS our ideas about the GR and time are given validation. On the other hand time is fickle. Time flies, time births and destroys kingdoms, empires, the industrial revolution. Time makes you old and kills you in some sense. In modern culture we think of time as a resource to be used and spent wisely. This is an instrumental definition.

(b) Clarification: "state of my nervous system" is just my way of describing "state of mind", somehow it feels more explicit, external, scientific and exact. In doing so I seem to be implying the outside world, this language that I'm using indicates that I seem to believe in entities outside of myself, and that I am therefore biased against solipsism.

(b) This question is more interesting. In some sense I am contained within a body, and in some sense the outside world is not me. But clearly we interact. Things go from the outside world into me and things from inside me go into the outside world. Take this letter for instance! I'm sitting here and my thoughts are being etched onto my harddisk in such a way that will be inteligible to another human, perhaps to me. If all the humans suddenly all spontaneously die, these markings on my harddisk will be as meaningless as a rock at the bottom of the ocean.

It's intersting that we use the word meaning in that way - I just said that if no-one could read my words they would become meaningless. My words are a form of communication.

Asside: Part of the reason for their existance is that writing enables thoughts to flow, so really they have a dual meaning: their shapes on the hard disk, but also in the fact that they passed through me and will alter me - why do I bother to have them? (a) because this is just what I feel like doing right now (b) because having these thoughts is meaningful to me - neither (a) nor (b) are sattisfying to me :End Asside.

Asside: What is the mixing time of the world? Is there a way to formulate that question that would enable us to find a sensible answer? It seems like we are able to tell alot about what went on in the era of dinasaurs... :End Asside

It seems there are two somewhat similar but slightly different meanings of the word meaning: (1) as used above, something that is intelligible (2) something that has moral value. Not sure what the word for it is, but I'm the kind of person who thinks morality is easthetic. As but a small element of this vast world I don't think it's my place to judge what is a good thing and what is a bad thing:

"I can only judge those things which I understand, and I can only act on my limited understanding and within my sphere of influence" - something about this statement isn't quite right. What do you understand? I understand that the world is a highly chaotic place, I don't mean that as a kind of insult - I mean it in the mathematical sense in chaos theory. Even the smallest action will change the world. But there are so many small actions being done all the time how can you possibly say that one small action is important? That's not what I said, you're missing the point, actions, small actions should not be viewed as unimportant true, BUT I am saying that those who say "this action is small, this action is great, this action is good, this action is bad" are often falling prey to the cognitive biase WYSIATI 'what you see is all there is'.

Complexity, chaos and WYSIATI are the ultimate killers of rationalism and utilitarianism. That's not to say that the utilitarians are wrong about everything, in fact in many cases they're really onto something. But as an over-arching philosophy, only the miopic can hold the view that actions should be judged in terms of their consequences, those who think they can do this are not aware of just how mysterious reality is. That actions should aim to maximize utility.

The alternative moral philosophy I am proposing is this: when it comes to deciding what you should do, think of life as a game, listen to what your body is telling you about what you think is right and wrong - because in the end, the moral compas of even the utilitarians was crafted by the blind watchmaker, and if you want to get down with the dao you must learn, love, and then follow your compas. When it comes to judging others' actions, don't ignore the deep deep complexity of reality, understand it and then act, case by case. In politics, employ some variant of realpolitik, or legalism.

If you like vortices that spin clockwise, then generate vortices that spin clockwise, it is likely that they will propagate and perhaps multiply. But if by misfortune your clockwise spinning vortices start to spin anti-clockwise, well, that just happens sometimes.

Hey body; looks like I got caught up in some other stuff there. I think you're a pretty good body. I'll take care of you.

One more thing (b) - the solipsism thing. The only argument I know of that refutes solipsism is the *doctrine of no atman*. Many evangelical atheists like saying that they don't have a soul, that the notion of soul is silly, and then go on living their lives as if they where an entity seperate from the world. These guys like most of us here on earth, are trapped inside themselves. The americans especially tend to reinforce this notion with their doctrines of individualism.

The hard problem of consciousness.

As much as I pull your strings you pull mine, to such an extent that we might as well eradicate the artificial boundry I have palced between us and adress this letter to myself.

With love from you.
